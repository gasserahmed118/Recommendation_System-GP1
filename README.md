# Arabic Sentiment Analysis & Recommendation System

## 📋 Overview

An intelligent recommendation system that analyzes Arabic text sentiment to recommend the most positively-reviewed items. The system processes multiple input files, classifies sentiment (positive, negative, neutral), and recommends files with the highest positive-to-negative ratio.

## ✨ Key Features

- *Multi-source Arabic text analysis* from Google Maps, Twitter, and Google Play reviews
- *Advanced sentiment classification* using ML and Deep Learning models
- *Real-time Twitter scraping* for current sentiment analysis
- *Visual analytics* with pie charts showing sentiment distribution
- *Smart recommendations* based on positive/negative ratio analysis
- *Web interface* built with Streamlit for easy interaction

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Data Collection
The system aggregates Arabic text data from multiple sources:
- *Google Maps* - Location and business reviews
- *Twitter* - Real-time tweets via Twitter API
- *Google Play* - App reviews and ratings

### Data Processing Pipeline

#### 1. Preprocessing
- Text cleaning and normalization
- Arabic-specific tokenization
- Stop word removal
- Feature extraction

#### 2. Machine Learning Models
- *Support Vector Machine (SVM)*
- *K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)*
- *Naive Bayes*
- *Decision Tree*
- *Random Forest*
- *Logistic Regression*

#### 3. Deep Learning Models
- *Feedforward Neural Network*
- *Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)*

#### 4. Sequential Models
- *Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)*
- *Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)*
- *Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)*

#### 5. Transfer Learning
- *CAML* - Pre-trained transformer model specialized for Arabic sentiment analysis

## 🚀 Getting Started


## 📊 How It Works

1. *Input Processing*: Users can either upload files containing Arabic text or enter search terms for real-time Twitter analysis

2. *Sentiment Classification*: The system applies multiple ML/DL models to classify text into:
   - ✅ Positive
   - ❌ Negative  
   - ➖ Neutral

3. *Visualization*: Results are displayed as pie charts showing the percentage distribution of sentiments for each input

4. *Recommendation Engine*: The system calculates the positive/negative ratio for each file and recommends items with the highest ratios

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- *Backend*: Python
- *ML/DL Frameworks*: TensorFlow/PyTorch, Scikit-learn
- *Web Framework*: Streamlit
- *Data Processing*: Pandas, NumPy
- *Visualization*: Matplotlib, Plotly
- *NLP*: Transformers, NLTK
- *API Integration*: Tweepy (Twitter API)
